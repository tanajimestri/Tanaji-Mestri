# [Healthcare - Capstone End-to-End Project](https://github.com/tanajimestri/Capstone-Project---Healthcare)

Problem Statement-
1. NIDDK (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) research creates knowledge about and treatments for the most chronic, costly, and consequential diseases.
2. The dataset used in this project is originally from NIDDK. The objective is to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
3. Build a model to accurately predict whether the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not.

* Performed descriptive analysis on dataset
* Visually explored variables using histograms
* Created Profile report using pandas profiling library
* Used LogisticRegression algorithm to predict the outcome
* Built a user facing API using Flask and deployed on Heroku platform - [Link to App](https://niddk-diabetes-prediction-api.herokuapp.com)

# [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Modeling](https://github.com/tanajimestri/IBM-Emp-Attrition---LogisticRegression)

IBM is an American MNC operating in around 170 countries with major business vertical as computing, software, and hardware. Attrition is a major risk to service-providing organizations where trained and experienced people are the assets of the company. The organization would like to identify the factors which influence the attrition of employees.

Analysis Tasks completed -

1. Import attrition dataset and import libraries such as pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, and seaborn.
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Find the age distribution of employees in IBM Explore attrition by age Explore data for Left employees Find out the distribution of employees by the education field Give a bar chart for the number of married and unmarried employees
4. Build up a logistic regression model to predict which employees are likely to attrite.

# [Customer-Service-Requests-Analysis](https://github.com/tanajimestri/Customer-Service-Requests-Analysis)

Problem Objective : Perform a service request data analysis of New York City 311 calls. You will focus on the data wrangling techniques to understand the pattern in the data and also visualize the major complaint types.
1. Exploratory data analysis
2. Converted Date features to datatime datatypes
3. Created 4 major insights/petterns in visual format
4. Performed statistical test for the following - 
   I. Whether the average response time across complaint types is similar or not (overall)
   II. Are the type of complaint or service requested and location related?
5. Stated the Null and Alternate hypothesis and then provided statistical test to accept or reject the Null Hypothesis along with the corresponding ‘p-value’.

# [Market-Analysis-in-Banking-Domain](https://github.com/tanajimestri/Market-Analysis-in-Banking-Domain)
# Big Data Analysis using Spark
1. Load data and create a Spark data frame
2. Give marketing success rate (No. of people subscribed / total no. of entries)
3. Give marketing failure rate
4. Give the maximum, mean, and minimum age of the average targeted customer
5. Check the quality of customers by checking average balance, median balance of customers
6. Check if age matters in marketing subscription for deposit
7. Check if marital status mattered for a subscription to deposit
8. Check if age and marital status together mattered for a subscription to deposit scheme
9. Do feature engineering for the bank and find the right age effect on the campaign.

# [Sales Performance Analysis using Tableau](https://github.com/tanajimestri/Sales-Performance-Analysis)
Analysis Tasks Completed -
1. Created a bullet chart with Category and Segment dimensions and Sales measures.
2. Blend the data with the Saved Sample - Sales Target data set to bring in the Sales Target measure.
3. Color code the chart to identify Categories and Segments that are above or below target.
4. Added the year of sales to the view to identify trends and outliers.
5. Added a filter so that the user can select one, more than one, or all years.
6. Created a dashboard which presents monthly sales performance by product segment and product category to help client identifying the segments and categories that have met or    exceeded their sales targets, as well as those that have not met their sales targets.
